# Orders app

This is pretty basic fullstack CRUD application I have created to try out some tools, libs and solutions. I didn't realy had an idea for something I could deploy and share with the world, this project was all about improving skills, not about the final product.

# Most important tech details

- Backend:
	- Nest.js
	- JWT authentication
	- MongoDB
- Frontend: 
	- Gatsby hybrid app (SSG langing page and client side app)
	- React Query
	- Several styling solutions (styled-system, styled components from emotion). Eventually most of app is styled using Tailwind

## Demo

Sorry if hosted app is not working properly, I don't have the time and will to maintain and fix bugs in those small projects :)
